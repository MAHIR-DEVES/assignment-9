project details : I have used many things to create this application like
tailwindcss daisyui react router and here are two json files which are about
upcoming events and another file where I have put blog data which I have used
dynamically in the json file in the upcoming section etc. and I have created
three additional ones which will not be able to login and those who are logged
in can go to get details and when they go to get details they are putting two
options name and email there they can make bookings besides I have designed the
login and registration page, I have made a dynamic title and from the challenge
part I am creating a page called My Profile where the user can update the
profile and I am creating a doggling system with the I button and I am doing
another one with the password and hide it. That is the forget password. If the
user forgets the password, he can forget the password. This is the over all
project and projector. I have taken the different types of designs that need to
be taken from different websites.
